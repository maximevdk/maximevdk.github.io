# Privacy Policy for Connected Abroad

**Last updated:** January 29, 2026

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Connected Abroad ("we", "our", or "the app") handles your information. Connected Abroad is developed by Maxime Van den Kerkhof.

## Our Privacy Commitment

**Connected Abroad is designed with privacy in mind.** We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to external servers. All your data stays on your device.

## Information We Access

The app may request access to the following device features:

### Photos
- **Purpose:** To select photos to share with your contacts
- **Storage:** Photo thumbnails are stored locally on your device for message history
- **Sharing:** Photos are only shared when you explicitly choose to send them via your favorite messaging app

### Contacts
- **Purpose:** To import birthday dates and contact information for contacts you want to stay connected with
- **Storage:** Contact information is stored locally on your device only
- **Sharing:** We never upload or share your contacts with any third party

### Notifications
- **Purpose:** To send weekly reminders to stay in touch with family
- **Storage:** Notification preferences are stored locally on your device

## On-Device Processing

- **Photo Analysis:** The app uses Apple's Vision framework to analyze photos entirely on your device. No images are sent to external servers for analysis.
- **AI Message Suggestions:** Message suggestions are generated using on-device processing.

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device using:
- UserDefaults for preferences and settings
- Local file storage for message history

## Third-Party Services

The app integrates with the following third-party messaging services at your request:
- **WhatsApp** — Opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message
- **Telegram** — Opens Telegram with a pre-filled message
- **iMessage/SMS** — Opens the Messages app with a pre-filled message

These services have their own privacy policies. We only facilitate opening these apps with your content—we do not have access to your conversations within those apps.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties. Your data never leaves your device except when you explicitly choose to share content through messaging apps.

## Children's Privacy

Connected Abroad does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is designed for adults who want to stay connected with family.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.
